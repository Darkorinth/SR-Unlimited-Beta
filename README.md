SR Unlimited Beta
I had to publish this since I am a github noob.

When you run it if Vigor is a fixer for you just do two missions for him, go into any safe house or bar and he'll call with a special job.

If he isn't rescue Piper, talk to him,he'll look for a picture of the box, as you leave the room Vigor should about being a fixer for you. Once he is see above.

Of course all this assumes I didn't screw up. This is NOT even close to a full story, it's just the next part.
